## Get the files
Q1. Download the following data files from the internet using the curl command: http://eaton-lab.org/pdsb/test.fastq.gz and http://eaton-lab.org/pdsb/iris-data-dirty.csv. Use the less or zless commands to look at the files. Then use the head command to print the first 5 lines from each file as output.

A1. Get the file from the internet using curl (with -O to suppress the output from the screen). Then use zless to look at the files. Before printing lines the file needs to ge unzipped if zipped (*.gz).

## Clean the data
Q2. Use grep, uniq, sed. Check that all of the species names are spelled correctly in the file iris-data-dirty.csv. Also check for missing values stored as NA. Create a new file where mispelled names are replaced with the correct values, and lines with NA are excluded, and save it as iris-data-clean.csv. Use cut, sort and uniq to list the number of data values there are for each species in the new cleaned data file.

To look for misspellings I sorted the file by unique using sort -u based on the 5th column. Misspellings: "versicolour" for "versicolor"; "setsa" for "setosa"

Code block:
Look for misspelling:
```bash
sort -u -t "," -k5,5 iris-data-dirty.csv
```
Code block - copied answer
```bash
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.8,3.4,1.6,0.2,Iris-setsa
6.4,3.2,4.5,1.5,Iris-versicolor
7.0,3.2,4.7,1.4,Iris-versicolour
6.3,3.3,6.0,2.5,Iris-virginica
```

To check for missing values stored as NA I used grep which searches for a string. I found two lines with NAs.
Code block:
```bash
grep "NA" iris-data-dirty.csv
```
Output:
```bash
6.3,NA,4.9,1.5,Iris-versicolor
5.6,NA,4.1,1.3,Iris-versicolor
```

To create a new file where misspelled names are replaced with the correct values, I used sed to replace. The > sign was used to store the output as a new file. NA values were removed by reverse selecting them with grep -v. To check that this worked we can repeat the commands from the first two parts. This shows that we have eliminated all NAs and all misspellings.
Sources: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26568952/how-to-replace-multiple-patterns-at-once-with-sed was used to figure out how to replace multiple patterns in one go.

Code block:
```bash
grep -v "NA" iris-data-dirty.csv | sed -e 's/versicolour/versicolor/g;s/setsa/setosa/g' > iris-data-clean.csv
```
When you look for unique Iris+wildcard it results in
```bash
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
7.0,3.2,4.7,1.4,Iris-versicolor
6.3,3.3,6.0,2.5,Iris-virginica
```

To list the number of data values there are in the cleaned file use cut, then sort, than uniq -c to count the instances of each unique. cut -f5 gets us only the 5th column (species name) and -d "," tells unix that the file is comma delimited. 
Code block:
```bash
cut -f5 -d "," iris-data-clean.csv | sort | uniq -c
```
Which gives the output:
```bash
     50 Iris-setosa
     48 Iris-versicolor
     50 Iris-virginica
```

## Summarize sequence data file
Q3. Find how many lines in the data file test.fastq.gz start with "TGCAG" and end with "GAG"
Since the file is zipped we start with zcat and then use grep twice for the two different filtering criteria. Starting grep with ^ indicates the string should start with that pattern and ending it with $ indicates the string should end with that. Wc -l is used to count the number of lines. In total there are 44 lines that match the patterns. 

Sources: https://www.tecmint.com/wc-command-examples/ for the line count command; http://www.robelle.com/smugbook/regexpr.html for how to indicate the line should start or end with that pattern.

Code block:
```bash
zcat test.fastq.gz | grep "^TGCAG" | grep "GAG$" | wc -l
```

44

## Summarize sequence data file
Q4. Write a for-loop to separate the reads from the file test.fastq.gz based on the taxon name in the label, and write the reads to separately named files in the new directory called sorted_reads/. The answer to this question will require more than a single line. See the lecture materials about using variables in for-loops. This will also be tricky because each read in the data file spans four lines (this is a standard genetic sequence file format), so for each read that you correctly identify you must grab the line with the sequence data below it, as well as the repeat label after that, and the quality information line after that. For a hint, see additional options for the grep command that can be used to select multiple lines.
